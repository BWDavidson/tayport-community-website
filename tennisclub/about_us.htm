	Tayport Tennis Club was first formed in the 1880&#8217;s and the first tennis courts were created
	on the site where the present courts are situated. Sadly enough the courts fell into disuse
	and became a dumping ground for all kinds of rubbish.</p>
	
	<p>Around 1914/15 at the behest of Miss Cobb, teacher at Tayport School, assistance from interested
	adults and school pupils was sought to 	remove the refuse with a view to the courts being brought
	back into use. After much shovelling and infilling of the hard surface courts, tennis was reintroduced
	as one of the early sporting facilities in Tayport at that time. To progress from the situation with
	no perimeter fences or pavilion, funds were raised by organizing Tayport Tennis Club dances. Twice yearly,
	large dances were held in the Temperance Hall and were considered the social event of the year.
	By 1927 a perimeter fence had been installed and a wooden pavilion erected by a local tradesmen.
	Three courts were now available for play.</p>

	In 1989 major refurbishment of 
	the playing surface took place which saw the provision of the 
	superior sand-filled artificial grass laid, at considerable 
	expense. In the years that followed, membership of the tennis 
	club reached an all-time high of 150 due mainly to the new 
	playing surface and the welcoming and friendly family atmosphere 
	that exits to this day. In 1998 Tayport Tennis Club produced 
	Scotland&#8217;s number one lady tennis player in Nicola Payne, who 
	was also ceded no 400 in the world.</p>
	
	<p>In 2003 another major 
	refurbishment was undertaken. After considerable fund raising 
	and obtaining a grand, the old sand-filled artificial grass 
	courts were replaced by three band new (sand-filled) 
	Astroturf tennis courts and another big improvement was made by
        installing floodlights.</p>

	style="margin: 10px; width: 350px; height: 256px;" align=right>The Tayport tennis club has 
	enjoyed the services of several highly regarded coaches, and 
	currently restarted junior Eastern holiday tennis coaching. The 
	huge interest of young players (and parents) bodes well for the 
	future of the club.</p>
	
	<p>Whether you are interested in 
	competitive tennis or social tennis, the club is delighted to
        welcome new members. While social members are the life blood of 
	the club, it has also produced some quality players in recent 
	years, playing in 2 Gents teams (div. 2 and 4) and 1 ladies team 
	competing in the various Tennis Tayside Leagues. To it&#8217;s credit 
	the club contributes significantly to our town&#8217;s community 
	spirit.</p>

    for ‘Tennis Taster’ sessions. <em>NO Charge</em> will be made for Tennis Tasters and all tennis equipment will be supplied.
    Information regarding when these sessions will take place will be distributed via the schools.

    <h3>Junior Teams</h3>
    
    <p>Although Tayport Tennis Club do not presently run junior teams, those wishing to play some team tennis
    can do so in the local WANT (Wormit & Newport Tennis) teams until teams can be raised from Tayport.</p>
    
    <h2>Adult Coaching</h2>
    
    <p>Tayport Tennis Club is committed to both growing our membership and providing opportunities for
    players of all abilities to improve.</p>

    <p>We understand that in today’s world, it’s difficult to make regular commitments. With that in mind,
    we have developed an innovative Adult Coaching Programme which consists of both regular weekday and
    weekend sessions and our exciting new ‘On Request’ coaching service.</p>
       
    <h3>Coaching ‘On Request’ Service</h3>
    <p>If you are unable to make our regular Wednesday/ Sunday coaching sessions, why not take advantage of our
    ‘On Request ‘ service.</p>
    
    <p>Simply give 24 hours notice to arrange a coaching session for a group of 4 players, or a one-to-one session,
    on a day and time that suits you.</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Group of 4 players @ £5 per person</li>
	<li>One-to-one coaching @ £25 per hour</li>
    </ul>   

    <p>That means coaching is available from as little as £5 per hour at a time that suits you!</p>
